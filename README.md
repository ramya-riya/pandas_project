# Impact of Technology Usage on Mental Health – Python & Pandas Project

This project explores how technology usage might be related to mental health using Python and Pandas.  
The goal is to clean the data, understand the distributions, and perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Objectives

- Analyse how different types of technology usage (e.g. screen time, social media, devices, etc.) relate to mental health indicators.
- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Use basic statistics and visualizations to understand patterns in the data.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas

## Dataset

- File: `mental_health_and_technology_usage_data.csv`  
- Type: survey-style data about technology usage and some mental health-related responses.

## What I Did

In this project, I mainly:

- Loaded the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame
- Viewed basic info about the data (rows, columns, data types)
- Handled **missing / null values**
- Did simple data cleaning (dropping or filling values, changing data types)
- Performed basic **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using:
  - `head()`, `info()`, `describe()`
  - `value_counts()` and simple filtering
- Looked at how some technology usage columns relate to mental health-related columns

## Files

- `impact_of_technology_usage_on_mental_health.ipynb` – main notebook with all the steps  
- `mental_health_and_technology_usage_data.csv` – dataset used in the notebook

## How to Run

1. Install Python and Pandas:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas
